BUG FINDING: Category filter not working properly

Issue: When searching for "florist carnes hill", all 7 Carnes Hill sites appear in results
even though NONE of them have the Florist category (id=60011) approved.

Database verification:
- Carnes Hill sites (1-7) all have hasFlorist = 0
- The searchSitesWithCategory function in db.ts returns empty when category doesn't match
- But the search.smart router falls back to centre-only search when siteResults is empty

Root cause: In routers.ts search.smart, when parsedQuery.productCategory is set but 
siteResults is empty (no sites match the category), the code falls back to showing ALL
sites from the matching centre instead of showing no results.

The problematic code flow:
1. searchSitesWithCategory("florist carnes hill", "florist") returns empty (correct)
2. centres = searchShoppingCentres("carnes hill") finds Carnes Hill (correct)
3. getSearchDataOptimized fetches ALL sites for Carnes Hill (incorrect - should filter)
4. The category filter override at line 982-993 is skipped because siteResults.length === 0

Fix needed: When productCategory is specified but no sites match, we should NOT show
any sites from that centre, rather than showing all sites.
