Floor Plan Marker Position Fix - Feb 5, 2025

ISSUE: Site markers on the floor plan were shifted to the right compared to their actual positions.

ROOT CAUSE: The container div had `w-full` class which made it take the full width of the grid cell,
but the image inside had `max-w-full h-auto` which scales down to fit. The percentage-based marker
positions were calculated relative to the container width (full grid cell), not the actual image width.

FIX APPLIED: Changed the container from `inline-block w-full` to `inline-block` only (via style prop),
and added `block` class to the image. This makes the container match the image width exactly.

RESULT AFTER FIX:
Looking at the screenshot, the markers now appear correctly positioned:
- Ground Floor: Site 2 marker is positioned correctly near Coles
- Ground Floor: Sites 10 and 11 markers are positioned correctly near the ENTRY
- Mezzanine Level: L2-3 and L2-9 markers are positioned correctly

The markers now align with the actual floor plan positions instead of being shifted to the right.
