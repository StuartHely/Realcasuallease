BUG FIX PROGRESS:

After fix applied:
- Search for "florist carnes hill" now shows 0 markers (correct!)
- Message shows "Your requested size is not available. Let me show you the other sites."
- But there are no sites shown in the availability table (correct behavior)

The fix is working - sites without the florist category are now excluded.

However, the message is misleading - it says "size is not available" but the issue is category.
Need to update the message to be more accurate when category filter returns no results.

Also need to check if the centre should even be shown when no sites match the category.
