Floor Plan Investigation - Eastgate Bondi Junction

OBSERVATION:
The Centre Floor Plan now shows two floors side by side:
- Ground Floor: Shows markers for sites 2, 10, 11 (3 markers total)
- Mezzanine Level: Shows markers for L2-3, L2-9 (2 markers total)

The floor plan images appear to be correct - they show the actual floor plan images with site markers overlaid.

POTENTIAL ISSUE:
The user mentioned "site locations differ from search results maps" - need to verify:
1. Are the marker positions (x, y coordinates) correct for each site?
2. Are the sites being placed on the correct floor level?

Sites in search results:
- Site 2: Ground Floor
- Site 10: Ground Floor  
- Site 11: Ground Floor
- Site L2-33: Mezzanine Level (shows as L2-3 in floor plan)
- Site L2-99: Mezzanine Level (shows as L2-9 in floor plan)

POSSIBLE DISCREPANCY:
Looking at the markers on the floor plan:
- Ground Floor shows markers at positions that may not match the actual site locations
- The marker positions are stored in the database (mapX, mapY coordinates)
- Need to check if the coordinates are correct or if they need to be updated

Next step: Check the site coordinates in the database vs the floor plan image dimensions.
